# The PWA-Cookbook üë®‚Äçüç≥
By: Anna Denzel, Alexander Reiprich

## Description
This project was part of the module 'Progressive Web Applications' at HTWK Leipzig in the summer of 2024. The final version is a functioning cookbook where users can create and store recipes. If they sign up, the recipes get stored online and can be made public for everyone to see - this way, other people can save the recipes and grow their own collection. Since the application is a PWA, it can be installed on to mobile devices and features synchronization across devices if logged in.

## How to use
### Hosting it yourself

1. Clone repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start` - if this doesn't work, `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`
